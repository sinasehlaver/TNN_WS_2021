# Perzeptron

A python implementation of Perzeptron.

## Usage

Provided that the "PA-A-train.txt" file is in the same directory with the script, you should be able to use python3 to run this python script.

```bash
python3 perzeptron.py
```

It will not print anything and it should create a file named "weights.txt" that include the weights for the perzeptron.
